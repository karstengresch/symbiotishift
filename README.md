# Welcome! Hack along with OpenShift@symbioticon 2018

Hi! We're so proud offering you a fully-fledged OpenShift server for your development and demoing needs at the **symbioticon 2018** in Frankfurt.

To get you started quickly, we the collected information we think is most needed for the hackathon. 

## What is OpenShift
OpenShift is a developer-centric enterprise Kubernetes distribution orchestrating an OCI compatible container runtime like docker naka moby. 
It covers the entire lifecycle from code commit to running your containerized application in production with built-in functionality.

All the functionality that either needs to be manually configured for Kubernetes or doesn't exist at all in it is available via UI and a developer API ready to use in CLI tools and IDEs.

## Why Should the Team use OpenShift
We have set up an individual OpenShift cluster *each* for up to eight teams.

This cluster is ready to use and brings you the following advantages:

  * Run apps in docker containers and make them available on the internet.
  * Use source-to-image (s2i) containers and benefit from the integrated build pipeline. s2i + GitHub repo -> commit -> new container. Completely automatically!
  * Select, mix and match your technology stack from the broad service catalogue offering available, e.g.
      * Java (with Spring Boot, Spring Applications, Wildlfy/JBoss EAP, Tomcat, Vert.x, Wildfly Swarm)
      * Node.js
      * Python
      * Ruby
      * PHP
      * .NET
      * Middleware (e.g. Infinispan/JBoss Data Grid Cache, Apache Camel/JBoss FUSE, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis/AMQ)
      * Databases (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Mongo, Redis)
      * ML (Spark cluster and running in two minutes, Jupiter Notebooks, JDG Computing Grid)
  * Skip IDE fiddling overhead, save precious hackathon time and use Eclipse Che running on the platform

## symbiotishift: Just an Inofficial Name :)
First a disclaimer: Red Hat is not affiliated with the symbioticon or the Sparkassen Gruppe at all, but on of many sponsors. 
We used the name in the tradition of other OpenShift related tools (minishift, nodeshift) and just found it funny. Relax.
